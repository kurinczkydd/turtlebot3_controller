## Overview

This simulation project focuses on recreating the functionality of an autonomous Roomba vacuum cleaner with enhanced navigation and obstacle detection capabilities. The Lidar sensor plays a crucial role in mapping the environment and detecting obstacles, allowing the robot to efficiently navigate and clean a designated area. The core of the project is a semi-complex sweeping algorithm that processes Lidar data to optimize the cleaning path, ensuring maximum coverage while avoiding obstacles.

Key Features
+ Lidar Integration: The simulation leverages Lidar data to create an accurate real-time map of the environment, enabling precise navigation and obstacle avoidance.
+ Advanced Sweeping Algorithm: The cleaning algorithm is designed to maximize coverage while minimizing redundant movements, based on real-time Lidar data analysis.
+ ROS2 and Python Implementation: The project is implemented using ROS2, providing robust middleware for robot development, and Python, ensuring a flexible and extensible codebase.

This project is ideal for anyone interested in robotics, autonomous systems, or ROS2, and it serves as a practical example of integrating Lidar technology into a simulated environment.
